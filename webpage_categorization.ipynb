       "' Derek Hoiem is co-founder and Chief Science Officer of Reconstruct, which visually documents construction sites, matching images to plans and analyzing productivity and risk for delay The AI Institute for Molecular Discovery, Synthetic Strategy, and Manufacturing, led by Huimin Zhao from Chemical Engineering, involves Heng Ji and Jian Peng as investigators The AI Institute for Future Agricultural Resilience, Management, and Sustainability (AIFARMS), led by Vikram Adve from CS, features Romit Chowdhary as Associate Director of Research, with other investigators including Alexander Schwing, Katherine Driggs-Campbell, Indranil Gupta, Kris Hauser, Julia Hockenmaier, Heng Ji, Sanmi Koyejo, and Paris Smaragdis AI group research has led to a number of startups In machine learning, AI group faculty are studying theoretical foundations of deep and reinforcement learning; developing novel models and algorithms for deep neural networks, federated and distributed learning; as well as investigating issues related to scalability, security, privacy, and fairness of learning systems Robotics puts artificial intelligence into practice using machines that perceive and interact with the physical world Machine listening systems understand audio signals, with applications like speech recognition, acoustic monitoring, or transcribing polyphonic music automaticallyS Robotics faculty are developing novel planning algorithms for grasping, locomotion, and navigation; investigating multi-robot systems; as well as pursuing high-impact applications of robotics to medicine, agriculture, home care, and autonomous driving Girish Chowdhary is co-founder and CTO of EarthSense, a startup creating machine learning and robotics solutions for agriculture, whose work was featured in a 2020 New York Times article It combines expertise in core strengths with promising new research directions David Forsyth advises a number of startups focusing on augmented reality and image synthesis, including Lightform, Revery, and Depix Computer vision faculty are developing novel approaches for 2D and 3D scene understanding from still images and video; joint understanding of images and language; low-shot learning (recognition of rare or previously unseen categories); transfer learning and domain adaptation (adapting pre-trained systems to a changing data distribution); and image generation and editing approaches based on generative neural networks Crucial to modern artificial intelligence, machine learning methods exploit examples in order to adjust systems to work as effectively as possibleThe study of systems that behave intelligently, artificial intelligence includes several key areas where our faculty are recognized leaders: computer vision, machine listening, natural language processing, machine learning and robotics Computer vision systems can understand images and video, for example, building extensive geometric and physical models of cities from video, or warning construction workers about nearby dangers The excellence and impact of the AI group’s research has been recognized by a number of awards, including NSF CAREER (Amato, Hauser, Hockenmaier, Hoiem, Ji, Koyejo, Lazebnik, Smaragdis, Telgarsky), Sloan Research Fellowship (Hoiem, Koyejo, Lazebnik), Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship (Lazebnik), AFOSR Young Investigator (Chowdhary), IEEE PAMI Significant Young Researcher Award (Hoiem), MIT TR-35 (Li, Smaragdis), Intel Rising Star Award (Li), “Young Scientist” selected by World Economic Forum (Ji), “AI’s Top 10 to Watch” Award by IEEE Intelligent Systems (Ji), ACM Fellow (Amato, Forsyth, Warnow), IEEE Fellow (Amato, Forsyth, Lazebnik, Smaragdis), IEEE Technical Achievement Award (Forsyth), and Packard Fellowship (Warnow) Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture Natural language processing systems understand written and spoken language; possibilities include automatic translation of text from one language to another, or understanding text on Wikipedia to produce knowledge about the world The AI group at Illinois is strong, diverse, and growing AI faculty are playing key roles in two $20 million AI institutes recently funded by the National Science Foundation and the U In the last few years, AI group members received a number of best paper awards, including: IEEE Signal Processing Society Best Paper Award (Smaragdis, 2018 and 2020), IEEE MLSP Best Paper Award (Smaragdis, 2017), Best Demo Paper Award at the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Ji, 2020) Natural language processing faculty are working on topics such as grounded language understanding, information extraction and text mining, and knowledge-driven natural language generation for applications such as scientific discovery Machine listening faculty are working on sound and speech understanding, source separation, and enhancement, as well as applications in music and computing'"
