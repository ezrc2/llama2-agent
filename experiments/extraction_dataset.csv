https://cs.illinois.edu/research/areas/artificial-intelligence,"The study of systems that behave intelligently, artificial intelligence includes several key areas where our faculty are recognized leaders: computer vision, machine listening, natural language processing, machine learning and robotics.

Computer vision systems can understand images and video, for example, building extensive geometric and physical models of cities from video, or warning construction workers about nearby dangers. Natural language processing systems understand written and spoken language; possibilities include automatic translation of text from one language to another, or understanding text on Wikipedia to produce knowledge about the world. Machine listening systems understand audio signals, with applications like speech recognition, acoustic monitoring, or transcribing polyphonic music automatically. Crucial to modern artificial intelligence, machine learning methods exploit examples in order to adjust systems to work as effectively as possible. Robotics puts artificial intelligence into practice using machines that perceive and interact with the physical world.

Strengths and Impact
The AI group at Illinois is strong, diverse, and growing. It combines expertise in core strengths with promising new research directions.

Research Focus

In machine learning, AI group faculty are studying theoretical foundations of deep and reinforcement learning; developing novel models and algorithms for deep neural networks, federated and distributed learning; as well as investigating issues related to scalability, security, privacy, and fairness of learning systems. Computer vision faculty are developing novel approaches for 2D and 3D scene understanding from still images and video; joint understanding of images and language; low-shot learning (recognition of rare or previously unseen categories); transfer learning and domain adaptation (adapting pre-trained systems to a changing data distribution); and image generation and editing approaches based on generative neural networks. Natural language processing faculty are working on topics such as grounded language understanding, information extraction and text mining, and knowledge-driven natural language generation for applications such as scientific discovery. Machine listening faculty are working on sound and speech understanding, source separation, and enhancement, as well as applications in music and computing. Robotics faculty are developing novel planning algorithms for grasping, locomotion, and navigation; investigating multi-robot systems; as well as pursuing high-impact applications of robotics to medicine, agriculture, home care, and autonomous driving.

Research Awards

The excellence and impact of the AI group’s research has been recognized by a number of awards, including NSF CAREER (Amato, Hauser, Hockenmaier, Hoiem, Ji, Koyejo, Lazebnik, Smaragdis, Telgarsky), Sloan Research Fellowship (Hoiem, Koyejo, Lazebnik), Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship (Lazebnik), AFOSR Young Investigator (Chowdhary), IEEE PAMI Significant Young Researcher Award (Hoiem), MIT TR-35 (Li, Smaragdis), Intel Rising Star Award (Li), “Young Scientist” selected by World Economic Forum (Ji), “AI’s Top 10 to Watch” Award by IEEE Intelligent Systems (Ji), ACM Fellow (Amato, Forsyth, Warnow), IEEE Fellow (Amato, Forsyth, Lazebnik, Smaragdis), IEEE Technical Achievement Award (Forsyth), and Packard Fellowship (Warnow).

Registration Error Messages

Timeline
When is Registration?
Early registration for classes for each term occurs in the latter part of the previous term: Students register for spring semester classes starting the previous October/November; students register for summer and fall classes starting the previous April.

When do I register?
You should receive an email from the Office of the Registrar around the middle of each term. Following the instructions in the email, look for your Time Ticket (earliest registration time) on Student Self Service. Once the time stated on your time ticket comes up, you can start registering for your courses.

When is the soonest that I can register? When can I see my Time Ticket?
Besides sending you an email about your Time Ticket, the Office of the Registrar has a page about Time Tickets that may be helpful.

What happens if I wait until a few weeks or months after my Time Ticket to register?
If you wait, you may be unable to register for the courses required to keep you on track to graduate! Some necessary CS courses have been filling up the last few semesters, so we're trying to help you by restricting registration in many of our core courses (CS 126, CS 173, CS 210, CS 225, CS 233, CS 241, CS 242, CS 357, CS 374 and most 400-level CS electives) to specific majors. We lift the restrictions from many of those courses the Monday after early registration ends. If you haven't registered by then and find that you can't get into the class you need, you will probably be out of luck. You will have to register for the CS electives that are available.

What if I have a hold and cannot register during my Time Ticket?
If you have a hold for any reason that restricts your registration ability, let an advisor know ASAP (before registration begins, if possible). They will work with you as much as possible to get you a seat in your required courses.

Registration Checklist
Meet with your advisor for any questions about registration. First-year students are required to meet with an academic advisor in the fall. All undergrads in the CS department are required to meet with their faculty mentor before registration in the spring.
Clear any registration holds you may have.
Make yourself aware of Enrollment Restrictions.
Register for a complete schedule at full-time status. If you underload your schedule, it must be approved.
Verify your address.
if you are registering for your final semester, you must complete graduation information and add yourself to the pending degree list.
How to Use the Online Registration System
Registration is done online through the Student Self-Service system. The Office of the Registrar has a video with step-by-step instructions on how to use the system. (That page also contains written instructions.) Their pages on Registration Procedures and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) also contain helpful information.

Planning for Next Semester and the Future
Which courses should I register for?
This depends on (1) which courses are required for you to complete your degree, (2) which requirements you have already completed, (3) when a course is usually offered, and (4) which courses you might be interested in taking.

Degree Requirements
Requirements fall into three general categories:

Major requirements: courses required for your specific major - these are spelled out for each CS major: CS in The Grainger College of Engineering, Mathematics & CS, Statistics & CS, and CS + X.
General education requirements: to ensure your degree program is well-rounded - see the Engineering advising website for Engineering gen eds and the LAS website for LAS-specific gen eds.
Free electives: additional coursework to bring your credit hours up to the required minimum for graduation - Engineering students, be sure to check the Engineering free electives web page for courses that do not count.
Progress on Degree Requirements
You can follow your progress through your requirements using two main tools:

Check the requirements flowchart for your major for the suggested order in which major requirements should be taken, or use one of the course planning forms. (CS in The Grainger College of Engineering, Mathematics & CS, Statistics & CS, CS + X - see your X department for their requirements).
By checking your degree audit, see what requirements you have completed/are completing and have left to complete. You can access your degree audit on the web-based Degree Audit System (DARS). The Registrar's Office website has a step-by-step procedure for running a DARS Audit.
If you have a concern about your DARS (for example, if you have taken a course that you think should satisfy a requirement but it is not being counted), please email undergrad@cs.illinois.edu.

If your situation is not straightforward or you're struggling in your courses, you should talk to an advisor, Steve Herzog, Heather Zike, or Katrina James, before registering for your courses. If you're struggling, that might be a sign that you need to take fewer hours or fewer technical hours. If you're wondering if your proposed course schedule is manageable, ask your peers – and don't be afraid to get more than one opinion.

Course Offerings
When drawing up your schedule, pay close attention to course-offering patterns to avoid overloads! Some courses are offered in fall or spring only. If you're within two or fewer semesters of graduating, plan out the rest of your courses carefully so you don't need a course not offered the semester you intend to graduate. We anticipate this might be a problem, particularly for CS in Engineering majors who plan on completing the two-course Software Engineering or Senior Project sequence and/or certain focus groups. This also applies to Mathematics & CS and Statistics & CS majors looking to complete certain required courses at the junior and senior levels.

Information about individual courses
How do you discover what a course covers, if it is being offered, or if an elective might be helpful or interesting to you?
There are several critical sources of information:

The CS website. https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/courses (Provides a short overview of each CS course, plus Learning Goals.)
The Course Explorer. https://courses.illinois.edu/ (Provides the schedule of all University courses by term and a browsable database of general education requirements, in addition to other resources.)
The official Course Catalog and Programs of Study.
Many instructors maintain course websites, which may be helpful to visit when determining if a course is right for you.
Student-run resources like Dr. Everitt's Neighborhood.
Consider a CS 498 Special Topics in CS course!
Many faculty offer a CS 498 Special Topics in CS course, which tend to be small classes, focused on a topic close to a faculty member's heart and thus provide an excellent opportunity for a letter of recommendation and a future project or thesis. And you can use them to satisfy your 400-level CS elective requirements. For more information, including meeting times, course descriptions, and prerequisites, see the course (https://courses.illinois.edu/) and search for CS 498 to see the titles of courses offered.  Some current and past CS 498 Special Topics (others may be added):

Virtual Reality
Digital Forensics
Applied Machine Learning
Intro to Data Science
The Art of Web Programming
Algorithms for Big Data

Registration Advising, Faculty Mentors, & Piazza
Seeking Advice
Who is my advisor?
All undergraduates in the Computer Science department (students in any major with the words ""Computer Science"" in the title) are assigned a CS advisor.  If you have ANY questions about requirements, policies, and procedures, you can make an appointment to meet with your CS academic advisor or email your advisor.  Students not in a Computer Science major can seek advice during drop-in advising hours in the CS Academic Office at 1312 Siebel Center or by emailing undergrad@cs.illinois.edu. Advisors are usually on duty during drop-in advising hours (listed here). You can check to make sure - the drop-in advising hours are usually posted right by the door to the Academic Office.

Am I required to meet with an advisor before I register?
First-year students are required to meet with their CS academic advisor during the fall (you will be emailed about this requirement).  All CS undergrads are required to meet with their faculty mentor (see below), usually in the spring semester, to be eligible to register for the upcoming fall. If you have questions about scheduling, requirements, and procedures, you should see an advisor in the Academic Office or email undergrad@cs.illinois.edu.

Can an advisor get me into a closed class?
Having a backup course on your schedule is always best if your first choice is unavailable at registration time. Advisors usually cannot add you to a closed course, but here are some suggestions:

Check the class schedule. Read the course notes and check to see if a new section of the course may be added.
Keep trying. Someone will probably drop the course, so check frequently to see if someone does. Persistence is the key to getting the classes you want.
Call or stop by the department offering the course to ask:
Is there any way I can schedule this course?
Are additional sections likely to be added? If so, when?
Is there a waiting list? If so, can I add my name to it? (CS does not usually have a waitlist for courses.)
Expect to make changes during breaks or when you return to campus. Many students do not leave for winter and summer breaks with class schedules finalized.
Schedule a related course that would be a good alternative. That being said, don’t settle for courses that are not appropriate just because they are available.
Try again during peak schedule change times. Right before classes start and during the first 10 days of the semester, people frequently change their schedules.
Attend the first day of class and ask the instructor if you can register for the course. The instructor may tell you no; however, he or she may tell you yes if attendance is low during the first week and it appears that there might be room in the course.
If you can’t add the class right away, ask the instructor if you can attend the class in the meantime. That way, you will be sure you want the course and will not have missed anything if the course becomes available.
Faculty Mentors
All CS undergrads are assigned a faculty mentor (new students receive their assignments usually late in their first fall semester or early in their first spring semester). Typically, all undergraduates must meet with their faculty mentor by the beginning of April (early registration for summer and fall terms). If you have a question that a faculty member would be best equipped to answer, feel free to contact your mentor or any professor you've met with or had a course with in a past semester. Or, if you have a question about a certain area of computer science, you can find which faculty members specialize in that particular area. All our faculty members are listed by research area and alphabetically on the CS website. You can find these listings and contact information for each faculty member in the CS departmental faculty directory. See the Computer Science Undergraduate Advising page to learn more about faculty mentors and the advising process.

PIAZZA
CS uses Piazza as a forum for students to get advice from their peers and the Office of Undergraduate Programs. Many questions can be answered quickly when we pool our shared knowledge.

For simple advising questions, feel free to post them to Piazza; CS staff will monitor and answer them as best and as quickly as we can. This may save you a trip to our office (though we'd still like to see you - don't be a stranger!).

Here are some suggestions, guidelines, and comments about this service:

Use this forum to ask your peers questions about courses, sanity-checking schedules, internships, etc.
Use this forum for simple questions about department, college, and university policies.
Don't post academically sensitive information (e.g., grades, etc.) unless you post anonymously.
We've disabled private posts because such a post usually indicates that you should probably be coming in to see an advisor or the Director of Undergraduate Programs in person.
How to sign up for the advising Piazza: https://piazza.com/configure-classes/other/csadvising

Link to the Advising Piazza ""course"" page: https://piazza.com/illinois/other/csadvising/home

Prepare for Graduation
Check your DARS to ensure you know your remaining requirements and that you can fit them into your remaining semesters. For help, contact a CS academic advisor.
Make sure you reach the required minimum total hours. See DARS for this, and remember that DARS includes in-progress courses - anything you're currently taking this semester and anything you've registered for next semester - in the total hours!
Don't forget free electives! CS in Engineering majors need 128 total hours to graduate; all CS undergraduates in LAS need 120 hours. Just fulfilling your major requirements and gen eds will not be enough. Engineering majors, check the Engineering advising web page on free electives to see which courses DO NOT count toward your total graduation hours.
If you have any time conflicts among the remaining required courses, email the CS undergraduate advisors as soon as possible and let them know which courses are conflicting.
Declare your intent to graduate. You should do this through Student Self-Service when you register for your final semester of courses. Click on the tab ""Graduation Information"" to ensure the term is set at the term you are graduating, then follow the instructions to declare your intent to graduate.
Review this Graduation page from the Office of the Registrar to ensure you complete all the essential steps for graduation.
Complete commencement information can be found at http://commencement.illinois.edu/.
Registration Error Messages
The following error messages are commonly received during registration. Learn what they mean and what to do when you receive them. It may be helpful to read the course notes in the course explorer under the specific CRN (course reference number) you are attempting to add to your schedule.

Class Restriction
The class is being held for students at a particular class standing (i.e., freshmen, sophomores, juniors, or seniors). Try to add another section of the class. Check the class schedule to see if the department has posted when the restriction will be lifted.

Closed or Reserved
The class is being held for students in a particular program or major. Try to add another section of the class. Check the class schedule to see if the department has posted when the restriction will be lifted.

College Restriction
The class is being held for students in a particular college. Check the class schedule to see if the department has posted when the restriction will be lifted.

CORQ Error
Some classes require that you also register for a co-requisite or attached course. If you get this error, the error message will tell you the class and CRN you need to add. Type both CRNs in the boxes at the bottom of the add/drop screen and try again.

Departmental Approval Required
The department has restricted the course. Check the class schedule to see if the department has posted when the restriction will be lifted. Otherwise, contact the department for more information.

Link Error
Specific lecture sections must be linked to a lab or discussion section. The lecture, discussion, or lab must start with the same letter (A, B, etc.).

For example, I want to register for SOC 100. I need a lecture (AL1) and discussion section (ADA or ADF). If I do not have the lecture and discussion section selected, or if I register for a BL1 lecture and an ADA discussion, I will get this error.

Major Restriction
This class is being held for students in a particular major(s). Check the class schedule to see if the department has posted when the restriction will be lifted.

Program Restriction
This course is restricted to a particular program or major. Check the class schedule to see if the department has posted when the restriction will be lifted.

Student Attribute Restriction / PREQ or Test Score Error
You get one of these messages when you don’t have an attribute required of the course or section. Check the section restrictions in the class schedule. Most often, courses are held in this fashion for freshmen, James Scholars, pre-College of Media students, Weston or Allen Hall students, and so on.

Unless otherwise noted, these sections will not open to other students, so if possible, try to add another unrestricted section of the class.

Time Conflict With (CRN)
You will get this message when the time of the course you try to add conflicts with another course. Check to see if the course conflicts with either a discussion or lecture, and try to change the previous or new course to a different time."

Fifth Year Masters Degree Conferral & Commencement Policies
Graduation Convocation / Commencement Policy
Starting Fall 2018, students in a bachelor’s/master’s degree program will only be able to walk in a convocation/commencement ceremony once both programs are completed, and they will walk as a master’s graduate.  A joint degree program is a campus-approved program in which a student concurrently pursues two specifically identified degrees, which are conferred simultaneously. For graduate students, this is a combination of a graduate degree with one of the following: another graduate degree, an undergraduate degree, or a professional degree.

Confirm that Bachelor's Requirements are Met
Students in a joint bachelor’s/master’s degree program must meet with the Engineering Undergraduate Program’s Degree Conferral staff in the Engineering Undergraduate Program Office, room 206 Engineering Hall, to ensure all requirements have been met for the bachelor’s degree. The degree audit must be completed at the time students move into the master’s degree.  

In addition, students must submit any required paperwork to confer either their bachelor’s degree or master’s degree no later than November 1 for a December conferral or April 1 for a May conferral.  If paperwork is not submitted by this deadline, the college cannot guarantee that your degree will be conferred for that degree conferral period.

Add Your Name to Both Degree Conferral Lists
Students in a joint bachelor’s/master’s degree program must add their name to both the bachelor’s degree conferral list and the master’s degree conferral list in order to graduate. Students must add their name by the designated deadlines for each degree.  If either deadline is missed, this may require the student to wait until the following degrees conferral period.

https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/honors,"There are many opportunities for undergraduate students within the Department of Computer Science to be recognized for their exceptional work. Awards and scholarships are presented each year during the department's Spring Awards Banquet. The James Scholar program is open to qualified students within the College of Engineering and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. Each of the colleges recognizes its top graduates during graduation ceremonies.

College of Engineering Honors
James Scholar Program in Engineering
The gifted undergraduate student who is seeking the challenge of advanced and unusual academic opportunities and the maximum freedom in course selection will find such opportunity in the James Scholar Program in Engineering. In addition to the various honors sections, courses, and special educational opportunities made available by the various departments of the college, the program administers several engineering honors courses. These courses are designed to bring together James Scholars from throughout the college to study various interdisciplinary subjects.

The James Scholar Program is voluntary and therefore enrolls superior students who are actively seeking unusual academic challenges. It strives to interact with each student on an individual basis; its foundation lies in the student's interest and academic goals.

The College of Engineering requires its James Scholars to devise an ""honors contract"" in consultation with the honors advisor. For CS, honors advising, like other academic advising, is handled in the Academic Office. Contact undergrad@cs.illinois.edu for honors advising. For more information about the James Scholar Program in Engineering, including eligibility criteria, see the website.

Graduating with Honors in Engineering
Honors awarded at graduation to superior students are designated on the diploma as Honors, High Honors, or Highest Honors.

Eligibility
Honors Students with a cumulative University of Illinois grade point average of at least 3.5.
High Honors Students with a cumulative University of Illinois grade point average of 3.8.
Highest Honors may be awarded to any student upon recommendation of the department. The criteria used in selecting individuals for Highest Honors recognition include a GPA of at least 3.95 or a combination of a GPA of at least 3.8 plus one or more of the following: 1) evidence of a broad range of supplementary activities of an academic nature, 2) a substantial body of advanced CS coursework beyond that required for the degree (individual study, graduate-level work, senior thesis), 3) a substantial body of advanced coursework outside of CS, e.g., a second major or a minor that does not overlap significantly with degree requirements (e.g. not the Math minor). Highest Honors is necessarily selective, awarded to a relatively small fraction of students.  For students with a GPA from 3.949 down to 3.8 we look for increasing evidence of going “above and beyond” the minimum requirements for the degree in order to receive Highest Honors.
College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Honors
James Scholar Program in LAS
Within the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (LAS), the James Scholar Honors Program encourages academically gifted students to fully develop their intellectual abilities and achieve the college's highest academic recognition. Scholars are charged with the responsibility of seeking sustained intellectual achievement as undergraduates by achieving and annually maintaining James Scholar certification.

Only the top 15 percent of the entering freshman are invited to participate in the LAS's James Scholar Honors Program. These incoming students are notified of their admission with a letter from the dean of the college. Continuing or transfer students with a 3.5 (A=4.0) cumulative grade point average may nominate themselves as James Scholars.

James Scholars must meet the requirements each academic year to remain in good standing to continue receiving the program's benefits. To be certified as a James Scholar in LAS each year, scholars must fulfill the following criteria: complete at least two honors courses (one per semester) or Honors Credit Agreements during the academic year and earn a 3.5 cumulative grade point average.

AI4ALL programs are designed to bring together and highlight voices that have been historically excluded, and that will lead and shape the future of AI. We aim to serve the following students, especially those at the intersection of two or more of these identities:

Indigenous Peoples, Black, Hispanic or Latinx, Pacific Islander, and Southeast Asian
Trans and non-binary; two-spirit; cis women and girls
Lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, and queer
Students with a demonstrated financial need (for example, students who receive financial aid)
First-generation college student
Open to all Freshmen, Sophomores, and Juniors at UIUC. Discover AI is designed to accommodate both students with and without prior computer science or AI experience. No program fees. 

Why should students consider the AI4ALL Discover AI program?

At the end of the program, participants receive an AI4ALL Discover AI certificate of completion.
Additionally, students will be invited to opt-in to Apply AI in the following semester - which  takes the concepts found in Discover AI further, and involves working with industry mentors on an AI-specific project.
Students that complete the programs have access to Changemakers  - AI4ALL's career development program that can also help program alumni find an internship in AI.
